A metamaterial��̢���̢��s properties are derived from its structure, rather than the materials it is composed of. As a result, its properties are not necessarily observed in its constituent materials. Metamaterials are made up of a collection of tiny scatterers whose separation is much less than the wavelength of operation, and therefore can be described by the macroscopic electromagnetic parameters: [epsilon] and [mu]. In metamaterials, the role of molecules in conventional dielectrics is played by small metallic or dielectric inclusions dispersed in a host medium.̉��� Due to the emergence of metamaterials in recent years, physical phenomena in both the microwave and optical regimes that were only theorized about a few decades ago are now possible. A few such examples are artificial magnetism and negative refraction.",0,,,,Mr.S.SHAFIULLA BASHA,,18/10/19,,,YOGI VEMANA UNIVERSITY,,Mr.B.P.SANTOSH KUMAR,,Control and Automation,,,7.89,,b.tech,,vbn3,500,,71.4,CGPA,,ST,hbvyf3,,,EE,Complete,jhukm3,,,,,,2014,India,10.0,iopu3,No,,,2016,,India,,,,,,,21/11/95,,,,2,12334567890,,Full Time,354.0,,Masters Degree,,,,,,,,
