A metamaterial��̢���̢��s properties are derived from its structure, rather than the materials it is composed of. As a result, its properties are not necessarily observed in its constituent materials. Metamaterials are made up of a collection of tiny scatterers whose separation is much less than the wavelength of operation, and therefore can be described by the macroscopic electromagnetic parameters: [epsilon] and [mu]. In metamaterials, the role of molecules in conventional dielectrics is played by small metallic or dielectric inclusions dispersed in a host medium.̉��� Due to the emergence of metamaterials in recent years, physical phenomena in both the microwave and optical regimes that were only theorized about a few decades ago are now possible. A few such examples are artificial magnetism and negative refraction.",,,,,,,View,,YOGI VEMANA UNIVERSITY,Awarded,,,,sfghu3,,,,,,b.tech,,Full Time,,71.4,,2014,0,,EE,,,
